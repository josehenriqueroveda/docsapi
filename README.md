# üóÇÔ∏è Document Management System

This is a Document Management System (DMS) built with Ruby on Rails 7.2. The system allows the management of documents, including their versioning, publishing details, and organizing them into specific shelves. Authors are also associated with documents for tracking purposes.

## Features

- **Authors:** Manage information about authors responsible for the documents.
- **Document Shelves:** Organize documents into shelves with limits on the number of documents they can contain.
- **Documents:** Create, read, update, and delete documents with versioning, publication dates, and statuses.

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.x
- Rails 7.2
- PostgreSQL with the `plpgsql` extension enabled
